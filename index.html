    This project is the host for the exercises 
    I've been doing while working in the Udemy Course: The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not following the course exactly as it is but I using this site to host the exercises 
        I've been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far the course has been pretty straight forward but the first lessons are very basic covering
        the part of HTML that I already knew when I worked with Web back in 2005 to 2008.
        Looking forward for the more advanced lessons.s
